### Abstract
We often consider multiple factors when we make value-based decisions. For example, when we decide what to eat for lunch, we might consider attributes like how tasty or healthy a food is, our dieting goals, current hunger levels, and so forth. Each of these attributes constitutes evidence for or against eating the food, with different attributes given differential weight depending on a personâ€™s momentary goals. How does regulatory focus alter attribute value construction and evidence accumulation? We recorded EEG during food choices while participants responded naturally or regulated their choices by attending to health attributes or decreasing attention to taste attributes. Using a DDM, we predicted the time course of neural signals associated with attribute value construction and evidence accumulation. Results suggested that event-related potentials (ERPs) correlated with the time course of model-predicted taste-attribute signals, with no modulation by regulation. By contrast, suppression of frontal and occipital alpha power correlated with the time course of evidence accumulation, tracked tastiness according to its goal relevance, and predicted individual variation in successful down-regulation of tastiness. Additionally, an earlier rise in frontal and occipital theta power represented food tastiness more strongly during regulation and predicted a weaker influence of food tastiness on behaviour. Our findings illuminate how regulation modifies the representation of attributes during the process of evidence accumulation.
